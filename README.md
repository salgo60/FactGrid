# FactGrid test with Jupyter Notebook and Binder and hopefully also [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)


Run this with 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/salgo60/FactGrid/master)

* the SPARQL ---> to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) part works using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) but not the [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) maps 

* see question in [binder discussion](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/kepler-gl-using-binder/5090)
* about using [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html)
