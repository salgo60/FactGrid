# FactGrid (Wikibase) test with Jupyter Notebook and Binder and hopefully also [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)

We are using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to access data and visualize data from [Wikibase](https://wikiba.se/) see example [The Illuminati Correspondence Fast Forward blog](https://blog.factgrid.de/archives/1695) / [visualisation](https://database.factgrid.de/tools/illuminati.html) - more about [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)

Run this with 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/salgo60/FactGrid/master)

* the SPARQL ---> to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) part works using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) but not the [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) maps 

* [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfRQQJ0vO44) showing how binder is started
* see question in [binder discussion](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/kepler-gl-using-binder/5090)
  * **Maybe this is solved, open issue is how to save config in a nice way**
* about using [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html)
* [Wikibase](https://wikiba.se/)
